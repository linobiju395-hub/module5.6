# 🕵️ Game Tester Report: CodeQuest - Forest Edition

**Status:** Ready for Play Store Submission ✅ (Version 2.0)

## 📋 Evaluation Checklist

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Theme** | 🟢 EXCELLENT | Bat and Fruit Tree icons are high-quality SVGs. Dark mode theme is easier on kids' eyes. |
| **Level Scaling** | 🟢 STABLE | Level 7 is significantly harder than Level 1, requiring careful sequence planning. |
| **Collision Logic** | 🟢 IMPROVED | The "Shake" animation and "Crash" overlay provide clear feedback for failure. |
| **XP System** | 🟢 FUNCTIONAL |XP rewards are increased (50 for lessons, 200 for modules). |
| **Performance** | 🟢 SMOOTH | Level transitions are instantaneous with no memory leaks in the maze grid. |

## 🧪 Testing Logs

1. **Bug Check:** Verified that Level 7 (The Gauntlet) handles long command chains (15+ blocks) without lag. Status: **PASS**.
2. **Visual Check:** Verified Bat sprite floats and tree fruits are visible. Status: **PASS**.
3. **Save State:** Refreshed browser; progress was correctly pulled from LocalStorage. Status: **PASS**.

## 🚀 Play Store Recommendation
The "Bat Forest" skin is much more engaging than the previous generic robot theme. The difficulty curve in Module 2 is perfect for ages 7-10.
